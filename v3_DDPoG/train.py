The `Buffer` class implements Experience Replay.

**Critic loss** - Mean Squared Error of `y - Q(s, a)`
where `y` is the expected return as seen by the Target network,
and `Q(s, a)` is action value predicted by the Critic network. `y` is a moving target
that the critic model tries to achieve; we make this target
stable by updating the Target model slowly.

**Actor loss** - This is computed using the mean of the value given by the Critic network
for the actions taken by the Actor network. We seek to maximize this quantity.

Hence we update the Actor network so that it produces actions that get
the maximum predicted value as seen by the Critic, for a given state.

Here we define the Actor and Critic networks. These are basic Dense models

Note: We need the initialization for last layer of the Actor to be between
`-0.003` and `0.003` as this prevents us from getting `1` or `-1` output values in
the initial stages, which would squash our gradients to zero,
